# Scenario 02 - Datasets By Kind

## Details

### Description

This scenario indicates what datasets are available by kind - a single vocabulary of environmental domain and data type categories for all EIA datasets.

### Purpose

Shows integration of all EIA data on an environmental data type classification dimension, albeit a simple one.

### Logic

It is not possible to adequately differentiate certain aspects of datasets by just looking at their EnvThes classification, more information of a technical type is also needed. The EIA Data Kinds is the EIA's own vocabulary to add in more technical categorisation on top of EnvThes

### Steps

1. Select the Data Kinds option
2. Select options from the EIA Data Kinds Vocabulary
3. Spatial Datasets of this kind(s) appear on the map. If not spatial, they are listed but not shown on the map
4. Select the EnvThes Categories option
5. Select options from EnvThes concepts by which Datasets are classified
6. Spatial Datasets of this kind(s) appear on the map. If not spatial, they are listed but not shown on the map
